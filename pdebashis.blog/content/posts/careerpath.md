These are the different shoes to fill.

## programming 
These people make sure the code matches the design and give feedback into the design process based on their technical knowledge

## technical Lead
These are over-acheiving programmers who now also have a bunch of programmers to guide

## Implementation
These people understand the scope of the product and shape it to meet the client needs. This person is required to interface a lot with other teams and the clients

## operations
These people handle the production environment and manage all day to day activities involved in running the software in live.

## devops
These people make the job of developers easier and systematic by introducing software to automate the various programming, release and deployment related processes

## architecture/design 
These people figure out the overall technical design that matches the business needs, make tradeoffs between technical purity and practicality (e.g. X sucks but everyone in the company uses X so we have to use it too). They typically mentor programmers. 

## strategy/department heads 
These people review designs and products and make sure they are a good long term choice and fit it with what the rest of the company is doing, both in terms of product and technology stack. Work with people in similar roles throughout the company and makes sure everyone is headed in the same direction (e.g. if X is being deprecated make sure everyone is moving onto the same replacement). Mentor architects/designers
