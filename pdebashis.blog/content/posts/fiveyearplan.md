Purpose is unique to each individual. Professionally, I would like to have an indispensable role wherever I am. But where do i want to be in my personal life?

In five years time, I may want to go to the beach. I dont want an expensive indoor movie theater experience at my house. i can just watch a movie on my laptop or TV. I dont want an expensive bmw and have to wash and maintain it. I would love to just have an SUV, so that its doing its job and keeping me safe. I would like to be with friends and family who care about me.
