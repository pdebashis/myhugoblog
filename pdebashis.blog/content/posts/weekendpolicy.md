Weekends are a peaceful way to work with no one standing behind your shoulders. So you can spend appropriate amount of time on a task rather than doing it in a hurry. This leads to better quality of work and I end up enjoying more what of what i do. There is also less emails and chats for distractions.

 
I relax a lot on weekdays with tea breaks and chit-chats here and there. There are a couple of hours of relaxation that can be sneaked into even the busiest weeks. So, I dont mind putting in a few hours of my own time on the weekends, to get some actual work done. Some people are completely against opening laptops on weekends unless asked to. In fact if i am asked to work on a weekend, then I am against it. No one should assume you to get any work done on weekends. No one should ask it of you. But if you want to make your weekdays a little less stressful, you can pick up your laptop for an hour or two on the weekends.
