Back in the day while starting with programming, there was little exposure to real world applications. All the operating system and compiler design courses seemed highly theoretical and out of reach. But the language classes were a breeze. C, C++ and Java. So what to do with this language knowledge when there are no real world applications of value such as creating an automated bot to interface with telegram API and send a cat picture everyday. Instead, we used those programming skills for  solving increasingly complex competetive programming questions. 


NMPC was one such Monthly Programming Contest. Unfortunately, it was introduced in my 3rd year and was organized only 3 times in the next 2 years. The Sankalp coding contes however, was an yearly Contest and was organized without fail. 


Sankalp was a 2 day festival and the coding contest was held at night on the first day of the event. Participants would enjoy the cultural activities during the first day and then have a light dinner and get ready to spend the night at the computer lab. The coding club members would have made all necessary arrangements to commence the test. It was held on the hackerrank platform during my 4 years. In the first year, I remember trying to find out as much as possible about the event as I was neither allowed nor capable of participating. Most of the clubs accepted members from 2nd year onwards. But coding club only accepted members from 3rd year. But the sankalp event was open for 2nd year students as well.


In the 2nd year, I took part in the night coding contest. Even before the contest, it was known that there are a select few from 3rd year who would win but if anyone from 2nd year was going to win, it would be me. I went into the contest feeling like a champ and having no pressure and nothing to lose. Over the course of the night, I was not only performing the best from my batch, I was for some time in the top 3. But by the morning hours, the seniors surpassed me on the leaderboard. I cant remember accurately but I may have taken the 4th or 5th position. This gave me huge confidence and I remember the walk from the computer lab to the hostel in morning at 6 AM was an amazing feeling. 


In 3rd year, I was already part of the coding club by the time of the contest. It was allowed for coding club members till 3rd year to participate and I was clearly the favourite. There were others from my batch who had equally good chances to win. So I went in with lots of anxiety, pressure to perform and expectations to meet. This year I didnâ€™t enjoy any of the rest of the cultural festival arrangements. The night was a hectic one and the their were a lot of ups and downs in the leaderboard throughout the night. Somehow by the morning hours, I was on top and took the first position even though it was a close call till the last 30 minutes in the morning hours. The walk home after winning was even better. When I went back to my hostel, I remember waking up my roommate to tell him that I won. The second and third position were also grabbed by the coding club members of my batch and my friends - Mayank and Abhijeet.
