Testing Hugo Framework to setup a blog
## Why blog?
A lot of time is spent on technical work and their is no other outlet to put it out here on the internet.
## Why Hugo?
After working on rails for some time, I found the static generated sites (like Hugo) make more sense than having a full backend for a personal portfolio site. I do not have any dynamic content requirements and it was also easier to host.
