My name is <b>Debashis</b>. and I'm a code monkey. I specialize in cloud computing and big data.


I am inspired by a character named Milo Pressman from the TV show 24. Check him out [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Pressman).


Currently, I'm working on [discorb-monkeygames](https://github.com/pdebashis/discordrb-monkeygames) and [ruby-algorithmic-trading](https://github.com/pdebashis/ruby-algorithmic-trading).
